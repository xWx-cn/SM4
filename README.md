# SM4
## A Simple Coursework
In the software way, a block cipher algorithm - SM4 is implemented.    
You can directly use it.    
However,it provides low security level.So use it for experiment or something else that does not require high security level.
## Code Structure
### core
we have key_schedule/encrypt/decrypt modules, five work flows(ECB/CBC/CFB/OFB/CTR) modules and basic const in sm4.cï¼š    
you can compile it only(make sure you write "main" at the bottom of the code), run it to see how sm4 works(you can also change the test function 'test_sm4()' to test more)     
### test method
to test it, we have bmp_crypt.c, it allows us to encrypt/decrypt a .bmp file and analyse it in bmp:    
(if you change the code yourself,run 'gcc -g bmp_crypt.c sm4.c -o bmp_crypt.exe' before you run this part)    
(in terminal)    
use it for encryption:' ./bmp_crypt.exe  e picture.bmp'    
use it for decryption:' ./bmp_crypt.exe  d'
